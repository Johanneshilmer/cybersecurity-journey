Understanding past attacks can provide direction for how to handle or investigate inceidents in you job.

Computer virus today know as malware attaches itself to programs or document and spreads and infects more computers.

# Different attacks

- Phishing

Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. 

Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include: 

    Business Email Compromise (BEC): A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.

    Spear phishing: A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.

    Whaling: A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.

    Vishing: The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

    Smishing: The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

- Malware

Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. There are many types of malware. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.  

Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include: 

    Viruses: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.

    Worms: Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.

    Ransomware: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. 

    Spyware: Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.

- Social Engineering 

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. It’s the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible. 

Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

    Social media phishing: A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.

    Watering hole attack: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.

    USB baiting: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network. 

    Physical social engineering: A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

## Password attack

A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks that you’ll learn about later in the certificate program are:  

    Brute force

    Rainbow table

Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 
Social engineering attack

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Some forms of social engineering attacks that you will continue to learn about throughout the program are: 

    Phishing

    Smishing

    Vishing

    Spear phishing

    Whaling

    Social media phishing

    Business Email Compromise (BEC)

    Watering hole attack

    USB (Universal Serial Bus) baiting

    Physical social engineering 

Social engineering attacks are related to the security and risk management domain.
Physical attack

A physical attack is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms of physical attacks are:

    Malicious USB cable

    Malicious flash drive

    Card cloning and skimming

Physical attacks fall under the asset security domain. 
Adversarial artificial intelligence

Adversarial artificial intelligence is a technique that manipulates artificial intelligence and machine learning

 technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.
Supply-chain attack

A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.
Cryptographic attack

A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 

    Birthday

    Collision

    Downgrade

Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain.
